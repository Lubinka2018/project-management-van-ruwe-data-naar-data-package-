# Future

## Reminder: workflow

- Work in groups of three (or pairs); 'pair programming' style.
  - One of you is the _driver_: they share their screen and perform the actions.
  - The other(s) support(s) the driver, by e.g. looking up questions, and being
    active and engaged with the driver's work.
- Switch roles so that everyone in your team has been in the driver's seat:
  - The driver zips the entire project, and emails it to a partner *before the
    break*.
  - The recipient unzips all and confirms the project is complete.
  - Do not worry if you have not been able to finish the exercises. You can take
    your project to the next step.
- Ask for help when needed, we are happy to support you!
  - Use the "Ask for help" button in your breakout room. (Note that raised hands
    and chat messages will not be seen outside the room!)
  - A helper will join your breakout room.

## Exercise

In this exercise you will work with your new GitHub repository that you created in the past. You will work with the GitHub repository of the driver.

0. In an internet browser, open the github url that your received from the previous driver and click on `Fork` (top right)
    * Next, use all the default settings and click on `Create fork`.
    * This creates a copy that you own and can further develop. But it is still connected to the previous driver and could be used for collaboration.
1. Add a license to the project:
    * Click 'Add file' > 'Create new file', and name your new file LICENSE
    * Go to [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) and find a license
      that fits your project;
    * Click on the license of your choice, you should see a license text
      (for example, here is [the license text for the MIT
      license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)). Copy this license
      text (just the text!) to the LICENSE file on your GitHub repository, and
      click 'Commit new file'.
2. Connect your GitHub page to Zenodo.
    * [Log in to Zenodo's sandbox environment](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/login/?next=%2F)
    * Why are we using a Sandbox? The Sandbox does not mint a real DOI, which would be forever assigned to your test project. A dummy DOI might suffice for today.
    * Click 'log in with GitHub' and authorize Zenodo to connect to your GitHub account.
    * On Zenodo's main page, click on the triangle next to your name, and choose
      'GitHub'. Find the repository you just created, and enable Zenodo's access
      by toggling the switch to 'on'.
1. Make a release from the GitHub main page:
    * Click 'create a new release'
    * Tag the release with the version number. Note that it is common practice
      to prefix the letter 'v' to your version number; e.g.: v0.1.0.
    * Name the release. For example, using the version tag and the date (in
      YYYY-MM-DD format!)
    * Use the description field to copy the changelog information. Since this is
      the first release on GitHub, you can copy the entire changelog into the
      description. Future releases can be described by the changes made between
      the previous release and that one.
    * Click 'Publish release'.
1. Return to the GitHub page in your Zenodo profile. Verify that the repository
   is uploading. After the release is complete (this can take a while!), you
   should be able to click through to the sandbox page of your released project!
   * Under normal circumstances, you would get the DOI and place a badge in your
     GitHub README. Why should you not do this now you are working in the Zenodo
     sandbox?


### What if you finish early?

No worries, there is more to explore and learn. Here are some suggestions for what you could do:

- Did you know that software projects can be cited and that you can get credit for your project?
  - Add a citation.CFF file to your porject.
  - Find out about citation files [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files)    

- Try to explore features of GitHub. How can you work together on the same project?
  - the driver add the other team members as collaborators to the GitHub repository.
  - all collaborators use GitHub Desktob App to access the GitHub repository.
  - Try to make changes for the same file and try to push it to GitHub. What happens?
