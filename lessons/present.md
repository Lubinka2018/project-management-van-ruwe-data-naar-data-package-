# Present

## Reminder: workflow

- Work in groups of three (or pairs); 'pair programming' style.
  - One of you is the _driver_: they share their screen and perform the actions.
  - The other(s) support(s) the driver, by e.g. looking up questions, and being
    active and engaged with the driver's work.
- Switch roles so that everyone in your team has been in the driver's seat:
  - The driver zips the entire project, and emails it to a partner *before the
    break*.
  - The recipient unzips all and confirms the project is complete.
  - Do not worry if you have not been able to finish the exercises. You can take
    your project to the next step.
- Ask for help when needed, we are happy to support you!
  - Use the "Ask for help" button in your breakout room. (Note that raised hands
    and chat messages will not be seen outside the room!)
  - A helper will join your breakout room.

## Exercise

**Before you start:** Make sure you have [downloaded the
data](https://github.com/meronvermaas/2022-06-23-DCC-project-management/raw/main/data/datafiles.zip) .
Unzip the files.

*Please note that the information about the data below is fictional, and for
the purposes of the exercise. If you want to learn more about the data used in
these exercises, [click here](../data/README.md).*

You are working on a research project on [Wood
ducks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_duck), and have sent students to the
field to collect data. They have taken your template, and filled out information
about the nests they surveyed. These raw data inputs are your starting point. It
is your job to turn them into a shareable project.

1. Create a single folder in which the entire project will be contained. Give it
   a simple name (without spaces).
1. Devise a project structure. What folders do you need, and how will you
   structure them?
1. Place the data files in one of the folders. Rename them so it is clear what
   they contain.
1. Create one overarching data file that contains all data from the raw files.
   Consider:
    * Is the data in a 'tidy' format, so future processing will be smooth?
    * Do all units match? Is it clear what they are?
    * Is the file format interoperable?
    * Where do you want to store this file in your folder structure?
1. Write README files for your project:
    * Start with a README for the entire project, in the root of the project folder.
    * Do you think it is necessary to create a README for the data? Why (not)? If
      yes: make one!
    * You can write your files in plain text (use a text editor, like Notepad,
      for this, not Word) and save them in the `.txt` format. If you feel
      comfortable with Markdown, you can use [Markdown
      formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) in your text and
      save your files as `README.md`.

When you are done: zip the entire project, and email it to your partner. They
will continue as the driver during [PAST](past.md).
